  <p>An incoming freshman at the University of Washington, interested in pursuing Computer Science (check in with me after fall quarter to see how that's going)</p>
  <p>Very interested in politics and international relations especially how different media sources change different constiuents' sentiments.</p>
  <p>A degerenate youth with the attention span of a bee and the mental capacity of a single slice toaster.</p>
  <p>Doesn't think politics is as boring as some assume it to be.</p>
  <p>In fact, believes politics is spicy.</p>
